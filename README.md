# breast-cancer-detection

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect breast cancer based on diagnostic features of cell nuclei present in a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The primary goal is to classify the tumors as either malignant or benign.

**Features**
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distribution, correlations, and key patterns.
3. Model Development: Implementing various machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   
**Technologies Used**
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
3. Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
